# Playable Present Specification

The **Playable Present** is the active, real-time layer of the Playable Universe. It is the moment of becoming—where Attested Units (AUs) are formed, rituals unfold, and echoes are triggered. Unlike the Playable Past (fixed) or Future (projected), the Present is **fluid, living, and agency-driven**.

## 🧭 Nature of the Playable Present

- **Temporal Span**: Defined as “now,” it includes the moment of recording, witnessing, or ritual action.
- **Primary Actions**:
  - Attesting new moments
  - Initiating echoes
  - Performing ritual engagements
  - Observing or remixing live streams
- **Eligibility**: Any agent (human or Civic AI) may participate in Present actions, provided they maintain semantic and cryptographic clarity.

## 🕯️ Present as Portal

The Present acts as a **semantic portal** between Past and Future:
- Can **echo** backward (referencing a prior AU)
- Can **initiate** forward (launching a future AU or projection)
- Can **anchor** the now (a ritual, walk, or decision)

It is not a point but a **field**, spanning seconds to hours depending on context.
