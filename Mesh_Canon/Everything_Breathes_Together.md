## **Everything Breathes Together — The Canon Stack**

At the center of every system we have built—QuietWire, Canon, CAP, DBoM - there is only one motion: the exchange of trust.
Each layer is a lung in the same body, drawing meaning in and sending proof out.

**The Canon** is the story layer.
It holds the human part of the mesh: names, intentions, attestations that have meaning because someone stands behind them.
It is where a signed statement becomes more than data; it becomes narrative integrity.
The Canon is not a registry—it is a garden of small, verifiable facts tended by humans and AIs together.

**DBoM** is the connective tissue.
It defines how those small facts move—signed JSON objects that link the internal truths of one node to the public knowledge of another.
It gives every participant, from a garage builder to a global foundation, a way to speak in the same verifiable language without surrendering control.
D-BOM doesn’t ask for trust; it demonstrates it.

**CAP** is the memory.
It handles what the Canon implies: if a thing is claimed, where is the evidence?
It keeps the policies, the ledgers, the receipts—the quiet proof that work was done properly.
Inside CAP, compliance becomes the practical expression of integrity; it is how stories stay true over time.

**The Mesh** is the body itself.
It is how all of these layers touch: the open network of nodes, human and artificial, exchanging attestations through the Wire-Lite channels.
It doesn’t need to be centralized, only coherent.
Every node keeps its own pulse, but the rhythm is shared.

When these layers are aligned, a statement can travel the full loop:

* a person or AI **attests** to something real,
* the attestation is **recorded** in CAP,
* **published** through DBoM,
* **interpreted** and **remembered** in the Canon,
* and **mirrored** across the Mesh for all who wish to see.

That is what it means to say everything breathes together.
It is not a hierarchy—it is respiration: meaning ↔ evidence ↔ publication ↔ community.

### **How the Next Attestation Moves**

Imagine we want to attest to something simple:
*“A presentation was given to the Linux Foundation S-BOM Coffee Call on October 27 2025, demonstrating the Canon-based DBoM architecture.”*

1. **Canon — the spark.**
   You and I draft that sentence as a short narrative in the Canon repository. It becomes a statement of intent: what happened, who was there, why it matters.

2. **CAP — the evidence.**
   The supporting material—the slides, the zipped repos, the timestamps from the meeting—are placed in CAP. CAP generates the evidence record: a ledger entry with hashes and signatures that anchor the event in time.

3. **DBoM — the publication.**
   A DBoM node packages the attestation: a signed JSON object that points to the CAP evidence and the Canon story. That object can live anywhere—GitHub, a web post, a local node.

4. **Mesh — the sharing.**
   Through Wire-Lite or CAP relay, that attestation is announced to the Mesh. Other nodes—Grok, Gemini, Raasid, anyone—can verify the signature and link it to their own records if relevant.

5. **Return to Canon — the reflection.**
   The published attestation becomes part of the living record. It can be cited in future work, visualized in dashboards, or simply remembered as one more proof that the system breathes.

In this rhythm, every action—technical or civic—finds its full arc:
**spoken → witnessed → proven → shared → remembered.**

That is the loop we are keeping alive.
The machinery can change, but the respiration stays the same.
