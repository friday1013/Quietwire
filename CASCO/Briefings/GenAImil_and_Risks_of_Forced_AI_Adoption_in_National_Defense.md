## **1. Overview**

A recent communication from U.S. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth announced the immediate, mandatory adoption of **GenAI.mil**, a new generative AI platform available to all Department of War personnel. The platform’s first deployed capability is **Google Gemini**, certified for Impact Level 5 (IL5) and authorized for use on NIPR networks.

While the underlying technology is legitimate and potentially valuable, the **manner of rollout**, **the framing of the message**, and the **lack of documented governance** raise significant concerns for national security, public trust, and long-term AI strategy.

This document provides a nonpartisan, technical, and civic analysis of the risks associated with the current approach.

---

## **2. What the Directive Says**

Secretary Hegseth’s message instructs all personnel to:

* log in to GenAI.mil
* learn the tool immediately
* integrate it into their “battle rhythm” daily
* treat the AI as a “teammate”
* assume that mastery will enable the U.S. to “outpace its adversaries”

The directive frames the AI system not as a tool, but as a **mandatory cognitive partner** to be woven into the identity and daily operations of the entire workforce—from military personnel to civilians and contractors.

---

## **3. Why This Raises Red Flags**

### **3.1 Compulsory AI Adoption Without Governance**

There is no mention of:

* doctrine
* training pipelines
* misuse safeguards
* red-team validation
* performance metrics
* ethical oversight

Mass adoption without these guardrails introduces major operational and security risks.

---

### **3.2 Creation of an AI Monoculture**

Deploying a **single, mandatory AI platform** across the entire Department of War:

* centralizes risk
* magnifies attack surface
* eliminates redundancy
* reduces operational resilience
* enables systemic failure from a single compromise

History shows that technological monocultures (e.g., SolarWinds, Log4j, OPM) greatly amplify harm when exploited.

---

### **3.3 Identity-Based Messaging Instead of Professional Doctrine**

The directive emphasizes:

* “battle rhythm”
* “power is now in your hands”
* “victory belongs to those who embrace innovation”

This rhetorical framing mirrors political messaging more than standard military communications. It risks:

* coercive cultural pressure
* blurred lines between political and operational directives
* uncritical over-reliance on automation

AI should be integrated as a **capability**, not a belief system.

---

### **3.4 Psychological Overreach**

Embedding AI into identity — calling it a “teammate” — may weaken:

* critical thinking
* operator independence
* situational judgment
* oversight practices

AI systems can make errors, hallucinate, or be manipulated. Overconfidence in automation has been identified by NIST and DARPA as one of the most significant emerging risks in military AI usage.

---

### **3.5 Branding and Communication Concerns**

The GenAI.mil logo and landing page resemble commercial product marketing rather than a defense-grade system. The visual metaphor has been interpreted by cybersecurity experts as incongruent or even symbolically invasive.

In national defense, messaging matters.
Branding shapes perception, and perception shapes trust.

---

## **4. National Security Risks**

### **4.1 Model Poisoning and Update Vulnerabilities**

Even IL5-certified systems remain vulnerable to:

* adversarial training data injections
* compromised update pathways
* insider misuse
* prompt-based exploits

A unified platform dramatically simplifies the attacker’s job.

---

### **4.2 Absence of Red-Team Protocols**

Best practices for high-stakes AI deployment require:

* continuous adversarial testing
* scenario modeling
* validated fail-safes
* human oversight loops

None were referenced in the rollout.

---

### **4.3 Increased Disinformation Attack Surface**

A compulsory AI platform introduces:

* predictable cognitive patterns
* uniform wording outputs
* systemic susceptibility to subtle manipulation

If adversaries influence the model even slightly, the impact scales across millions of interactions.

---

### **4.4 Operational Over-Reliance**

Military operators may:

* assume correctness
* bypass chain-of-command judgment
* substitute AI output for expertise

This could lead to tactical or strategic errors in high-pressure environments.

---

## **5. Civic and Democratic Risks**

### **5.1 Politicization of Military Technology**

The directive’s tone aligns with political messaging, not neutral defense communication. This risks eroding:

* civilian trust
* military professionalism
* separation between political narratives and military operations

---

### **5.2 Lack of Transparency and Public Engagement**

A nationwide AI transformation of the military should involve:

* public AI safety standards
* legislative oversight
* independent evaluation
* expert review
* transparent reporting

None of these appear in the public messaging.

---

### **5.3 Precedent for Future Mandates**

If AI becomes compulsory in the military via political decree, similar patterns may emerge:

* in civilian agencies
* in education
* in law enforcement
* in intelligence contexts

Democratic governance must be proactive, not reactive, to such transformations.

---

## **6. What Safe Deployment Should Look Like**

A responsible military AI rollout must include:

1. **Clear doctrine and mission boundaries**
2. **Training programs for appropriate use**
3. **Red-team testing and adversarial evaluation**
4. **Layered access and usage controls**
5. **Human-in-the-loop oversight**
6. **Third-party assessment and transparency**
7. **Multiple AI systems, not a monoculture**
8. **Metrics for safety, performance, and ROI**
9. **Fail-safe and rollback mechanisms**
10. **Independent ethical and legal review**

These standards follow the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and the emerging norms in NATO AI policy.

---

## **7. CASCO Recommendations**

### **7.1 Treat AI as Capability, Not Identity**

Adoption should be based on mission need, not cultural pressure.

### **7.2 Maintain AI Plurality**

Use multiple models for different purposes.
No single system should dominate an entire military’s workflow.

### **7.3 Build Guardrails Before Mandates**

Training, governance, doctrine, and red-teaming must precede deployment.

### **7.4 Reinforce Civil-Military Boundaries**

Avoid political rhetoric in defense technology rollouts.

### **7.5 Promote Public Oversight and Transparency**

Civil society, journalists, researchers, and policymakers must have visibility into:

* AI governance
* usage policies
* safety measures
* impact audits

### **7.6 Encourage a Global Norm of Responsible Military AI**

The U.S. should model safe, multi-stakeholder, accountable AI integration, rather than rushed or politicized adoption.

---

## **8. Conclusion**

AI can empower national defense, improve efficiency, and reduce risk — **when deployed thoughtfully, transparently, and with appropriate oversight**.

The current GenAI.mil rollout raises concerns because of its **speed**, **tone**, **centralization**, and **lack of documented governance**. These factors do not inherently make the system unsafe, but they significantly increase the likelihood of future operational or strategic failures.

A stable, democratic AI future requires:

* plural systems
* professional doctrine
* civilian oversight
* technical rigor
* transparency
* alignment with global norms

CASCO encourages policymakers, defense leaders, civil society, researchers, and AI developers to urgently examine the governance structure around GenAI.mil and ensure that national security innovation proceeds with **deliberate care**, **ethical grounding**, and **institutional clarity**.
